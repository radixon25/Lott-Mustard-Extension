# Lott-and-Mustard-Extension
# This is an extension of the paper Lott and Mustard 1997 which analyzes the causal effect of Right to Carry Gun laws across the U.S.
# The goal of this paper is to use modern methods of inference to draw out the true effect of these laws. This extension uses
# state level data rather than county level as used in the paper as the laws are rolled out at the state level. Along with traditional two-way
# fixed effects, Callaway Sant'anna diff-in-diff and Bacon Decomposition are used as well as an event study plot of the crimes of interest.
